# RNA-Seq analysis using Salmon and DESeq2

There are many methods developed for the mapping and quantification of RNA sequencing data. For my analysis I chose to use the Salmon package developed by the [COMBINE-lab](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon). For my analysis I decided to run this using the combine lab's docker image which is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/salmon).
