# Survival analysis

Survival analysis was used to compare the survival of [endemic and 
sporadic](https://github.com/blain1995/thesis_scripts/tree/main/Survival/sBL_eBL_survival.R), and the survival of 
[sBL](https://github.com/blain1995/thesis_scripts/tree/main/Survival/TP53_sBL.R) and 
[eBL](https://github.com/blain1995/thesis_scripts/tree/main/Survival/eBL_TP53.R) patients with and without *TP53* 
abnormalities.
